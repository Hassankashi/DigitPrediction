Programming Exercise 3:
Multi-class Classication and Neural Networks
Machine Learning
Introduction
In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits. Before starting the programming
exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing
the review questions for the associated topics.
To get started with the exercise, download the starter code and unzip its
contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed,
use the cd command in Octave to change to this directory before starting
this exercise.
Files included in this exercise
ex3.m - Octave script that will help step you through part 1
ex3 nn.m - Octave script that will help step you through part 2
ex3data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits
ex3weights.mat - Initial weights for the neural network exercise
submitWeb.m - Alternative submission script
submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers
displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset
fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)
sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function
[?] lrCostFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function
[?] oneVsAll.m - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classier
[?] predictOneVsAll.m - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classier
[?] predict.m - Neural network prediction function
? indicates les you will need to complete

Throughout the exercise, you will be using the scripts ex3.m and ex3 nn.m.
These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions
that you will write. You do not need to modify these scripts. You are only
required to modify functions in other les, by following the instructions in
this assignment.
